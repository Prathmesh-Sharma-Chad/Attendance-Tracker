Thank you for using this no brainer project which i made for no reason, other than that i wanted to make it
<br>
<br>
You can download the exe file and run it, and thats it.
<br>
i'll be adding customizing subjects in the future updates.
<br>
for now if you want to you can also clone the repo or copy the Main.cpp file and edit the subjects to your liking
<br>
Your feedback and suggestions are much appreciated
