Thank you for using this no brainer project which i made for no reason, other than that i wanted to make it


You can download the exe file and run it, and thats it.

i'll be adding customizing the subjects feature in the future updates.

for now if you want to you can also clone the repo or copy the Main.cpp file or the code inside it and edit the subjects.

Your feedback and suggestions are much appreciated
